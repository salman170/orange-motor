            As one of Indiaâ€™s foremost home-grown automotive brands, we are
            delighted to have reached this significant milestone for our
            passenger vehicles segment. We are honoured to have the legendary
            Mr. Anupam Kher as the narrator of the glorious journey of a brand
            that is a legend in itself. This film is a testament to not only our
            evolutionary growth over the last 30 years but also the growth that
            India has seen as a nation through this period. This narration
            celebrates Tata Motors and all those who have supported us in these
            years, as we continue to provide class-defining products to our
            consumers, thereby allowing us to be thought leaders in the realm of
            design, safety and performance.
